Description: An implementation of conditional independence tests for multinomial data based on the permutation method. Unlike the classical asymptotic approach, the implemented permutation tests are exact in any finite sample scenarios and their validity holds uniformly over the entire class of null distributions. This package considers four test statistics including the chi-squared statistic, the likelihood-ratio statistic (or G-statistic), and the test statistic proposed by Canonne, Diakonikolas, Kane, Stewart (2018) <arXiv:1711.11560> and its practical variant without sample splitting proposed by Kim et al. (2022+).
